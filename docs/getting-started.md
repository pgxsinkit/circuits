# Getting started: your first live queries

This is the from-zero walkthrough: point Circuits at a fresh Postgres database, then create
and consume live queries with **nothing but HTTP** — regular live queries, subqueries, and
aggregations. Everything here is bare `curl`; the client SDK (`@circuits/client`) wraps
exactly these requests. Companion docs: [live queries guide](live-queries-guide.md) (concepts + the
SDK), [deployment-postgres.md](deployment-postgres.md) (production Postgres notes),
[how queries become live](how-queries-become-live.md) (how it works).

---

## 1. The example schema

A tiny issue tracker. Four tables, chosen so we can show every live query form: plain filters
(`issues`), a cross-table subquery (`project_members` → `issues`), and aggregations (`points`).

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id      bigint  PRIMARY KEY,
  name    text    NOT NULL,
  active  boolean NOT NULL DEFAULT true
);

CREATE TABLE projects (
  id    bigint PRIMARY KEY,
  name  text   NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE project_members (
  id          bigint PRIMARY KEY,
  project_id  bigint NOT NULL REFERENCES projects(id),
  user_id     bigint NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id)
);

CREATE TABLE issues (
  id          bigint PRIMARY KEY,
  project_id  bigint NOT NULL REFERENCES projects(id),
  title       text   NOT NULL,
  status      text   NOT NULL DEFAULT 'todo',   -- 'todo' | 'doing' | 'done'
  priority    bigint NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  points      bigint                            -- nullable, for the aggregation examples
);
```

Requirements the engine puts on your tables:

- **Every replicated table needs a primary key** (single or composite — composite keys are
  supported; the key is introspected from the catalog).
- Column types map to the engine's four scalar types: `int` (bigint/int), `float`
  (double precision), `text`, `bool`.
- The engine will run `ALTER TABLE … REPLICA IDENTITY FULL` on each table at startup, so the
  connecting role must own the tables (or be superuser).

Seed a few rows so the live queries below have something to return:

```sql
INSERT INTO users   VALUES (1, 'alice', true), (2, 'bob', true);
INSERT INTO projects VALUES (10, 'engine'), (20, 'client');
INSERT INTO project_members VALUES (100, 10, 1), (101, 20, 2);
INSERT INTO issues VALUES
  (1000, 10, 'fix the tailer',    'todo',  4, 3),
  (1001, 10, 'write the docs',    'doing', 2, 1),
  (1002, 20, 'ship the client',   'todo',  5, NULL),
  (1003, 20, 'triage the inbox',  'done',  1, 2);
```

---

## 2. Point the stack at the database

Postgres is the system of record — your app keeps writing to it with ordinary SQL. The one
setting it needs is logical replication:

```conf
wal_level = logical        # requires a Postgres restart
max_replication_slots = 10
max_wal_senders = 10
```

### Option A — Docker

`pnpm docker:up` (or `podman compose -f docker/compose.yaml up`) boots the whole stack:

| service | port | role |
|---|---|---|
| `postgres` (16, `wal_level=logical`) | 5432 | system of record — run the DDL above here |
| `ds` (durable-streams server) | 8791 | the change log; live query feeds are read from here |
| `engine` (Rust) | 7010 | replication ingest + live query maintenance + `/v1/shape` |
| `api` (extended API) | 8790 | live queries / subset queries / aggregations |

### Option B — three processes by hand

```sh
# 1. durable-streams server (the log)
DS_PORT=8791 node docker/ds-server.ts

# 2. the engine, pointed at your database
export CIRCUITS_DS_URL="http://127.0.0.1:8791"
export CIRCUITS_PG_URL="postgres://user:pass@127.0.0.1:5432/appdb"
export CIRCUITS_PG_TABLES="*"        # or "users,projects,project_members,issues"
export CIRCUITS_BIND="0.0.0.0:7010"
target/release/circuits-engine       # prints ENGINE_LISTENING <addr> when ready

# 3. the extended API server
DS_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8791 ENGINE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:7010 API_PORT=8790 \
  node docker/api-server.ts
```

`CIRCUITS_PG_TABLES="*"` (or empty) means *introspect every `public` table that has a
primary key* — never every schema. List entries individually as `schema.name` or a bare `name`
(= `public.<name>`), or opt a whole schema in with `schema.*`. On boot, per table, the engine: introspects columns/types/pk, sets
`REPLICA IDENTITY FULL`, ensures the current `changes/<n>` change-log segment, creates the logical
replication slot (`pgoutput` + a `<slot>_pub` publication, name from `CIRCUITS_PG_SLOT`,
default `circuits`),
and starts the ingestor. Nothing else to migrate or install in the database.

The engine's circuit tier — disk-spillable table arrangements, counts pipelines, and circuit
serving — is always on. Tune it (state dir, cache/spill budgets, which lookup indexes and
counts pipelines to compile) with the `CIRCUITS_DBSP_*` variables; the full reference table
is in `ARCHITECTURE.md` §6b. The LinearLite demo (`pnpm demo:linearlite`) runs the engine with
the full circuit configuration by default.

Check it's up:

```sh
curl http://localhost:7010/health            # → ok
curl http://localhost:7010/replication/lsn   # → {"lsn":"0/0","sync":0} until the first change is ingested
```

---

## 3. Your first live query — `GET /v1/shape`

The engine speaks the Electric wire protocol, so this is the zero-dependency way to consume a
live query: one endpoint, two request forms (snapshot, then long-poll). In the API these are
created with `client.shape()` and served at `/v1/shape` (the Electric protocol name);
conceptually we call them **live queries**. Here the `where` is a **SQL string**.

### Snapshot

`offset=-1` (or omitting `offset`) asks for the live query's current rows:

```sh
curl -i -G 'http://localhost:7010/v1/shape' \
  --data-urlencode "table=issues" \
  --data-urlencode "offset=-1" \
  --data-urlencode "where=status = 'todo' AND priority >= 3"
```

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
electric-handle: <handle>
electric-offset: <tail offset>
electric-schema: {"id":{"type":"int8","pk_index":0},"project_id":{"type":"int8"},...}
electric-up-to-date:
cache-control: no-store

[
  {"headers":{"operation":"insert"},"key":"1000","value":{"id":"1000","project_id":"10","title":"fix the tailer","status":"todo","priority":"4","points":"3"}},
  {"headers":{"operation":"insert"},"key":"1002","value":{"id":"1002","project_id":"20","title":"ship the client","status":"todo","priority":"5","points":null}},
  {"headers":{"control":"up-to-date","global_last_seen_lsn":"0"}}
]
```

Notes on the format:

- Change messages are `{"headers":{"operation":…},"key":…,"value":…}`; control messages are
  `{"headers":{"control":…}}`. Values are Postgres **text-encoded** (numbers and booleans arrive
  as strings), exactly as Electric clients expect.
- Save `electric-handle` and `electric-offset` — they drive the live phase.

### Live tail

Long-poll from where the snapshot left off:

```sh
curl -i -G 'http://localhost:7010/v1/shape' \
  --data-urlencode "table=issues" \
  --data-urlencode "handle=$HANDLE" \
  --data-urlencode "offset=$OFFSET" \
  --data-urlencode "live=true"
```

Now write to Postgres from anywhere (`psql`, your app, an ORM):

```sql
UPDATE issues SET status = 'doing' WHERE id = 1000;
```

The pending long-poll returns with the delta — here the row *leaves* the live query, so it's a
`delete`:

```json
[
  {"headers":{"operation":"delete"},"key":"1000","value":{"id":"1000"}},
  {"headers":{"control":"up-to-date","global_last_seen_lsn":"0"}}
]
```

(Deletes always carry a `value` — the old row when the engine holds it, otherwise just the
primary key, as here — because Electric's client parser requires one on every change message.)

Each response carries fresh `electric-handle` / `electric-offset` / `electric-cursor` headers —
loop with the new offset. If nothing happens within the long-poll window (default 20 s,
`ELECTRIC_LIVE_TIMEOUT_MS`) you get `204 No Content`: just re-issue the request.

If the handle has been evicted (idle for `ELECTRIC_HANDLE_TTL`, default 600 s) you get
`409 Conflict` with `[{"headers":{"control":"must-refetch"}}]` — restart from `offset=-1` (the
re-snapshot rejoins the retained live query; the engine keeps idle live queries dormant for days
before evicting them — see the retention section of `apps/engine/README.md`).
Malformed requests (unknown table/column, bad `where`) are `400` with `{"message":"…"}`.

### What the SQL `where` accepts

Comparisons `= <> != < <= > >=`, `[NOT] LIKE`, `[NOT] BETWEEN a AND b`, `[NOT] IN (list)`,
`[NOT] IN (SELECT …)` (next section), `IS [NOT] NULL`, `AND` / `OR` / `NOT`, parentheses,
`true` / `false`. NULL follows SQL three-valued logic — the engine's results match a Postgres
oracle exactly, and the conformance suite asserts it.

### Projecting columns

`columns` limits *what is synced* (not what is matched); the primary key is always included:

```sh
  --data-urlencode "columns=id,title,status"
```

---

## 4. Subqueries

The one cross-table form: a column is `[NOT] IN` a single-column subquery, nestable. The
canonical use is per-user visibility — *issues in projects alice belongs to*:

```sh
curl -i -G 'http://localhost:7010/v1/shape' \
  --data-urlencode "table=issues" \
  --data-urlencode "offset=-1" \
  --data-urlencode "where=project_id IN (SELECT project_id FROM project_members WHERE user_id = 1)"
```

This live query *spans both tables*: add alice to project 20
(`INSERT INTO project_members VALUES (102, 20, 1)`) and every issue of project 20 upserts into
her live query on the next poll; remove her and they delete. No re-query — the membership
table's own delta drives it.

Subqueries nest recursively:

```sql
project_id IN (SELECT project_id FROM project_members
               WHERE user_id IN (SELECT id FROM users WHERE active = true))
```

`NOT IN` works too, with SQL semantics: if the inner set contains a NULL, `NOT IN` is UNKNOWN
for every row — same as Postgres.

The subquery grammar is deliberately narrow: `SELECT <one column> FROM <table> [WHERE …]` —
no joins, no `EXISTS`, no correlated subqueries (see the live queries guide §4 for what to do
instead). Identical inner subqueries across live queries share **one** maintained inner-set node
on the engine, automatically — a thousand per-user live queries cost a thousand tiny membership
sets, not a thousand copies of `issues`.

---

## 5. The extended API — live queries as resources, feeds from the log

The extended API (port 8790) is where the API is headed: it adds subset queries and
aggregations, takes predicates as a **JSON AST** instead of SQL, and separates *creating* a
live query from *reading* it — you create a live query once and read its feed directly from the
durable-streams server (port 8791), which is what makes de-duplication end-to-end: every client
of an identical live query tails the same stream.

It's tRPC (v11, no transformer) served at the URL root, so bare HTTP is simple: **mutations are
`POST /<procedure>` with the raw input as the JSON body; queries are `GET /<procedure>?input=<url-encoded JSON>`**.
Responses are wrapped in the standard tRPC envelope `{"result":{"data":…}}`.

### Create a live query

```sh
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8790/shapes.create \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "table": "issues",
    "where": { "and": [
      { "col": "status",   "op": "eq",  "value": "todo" },
      { "col": "priority", "op": "gte", "value": 3 }
    ] },
    "columns": ["id", "title", "status", "priority"]
  }'
```

```json
{"result":{"data":{
  "shapeId": "<id>",
  "table": "public.issues",
  "streamPath": "shape/<id>",
  "streamUrl": "http://localhost:8791/shape/<id>"
}}}
```

Creating the same live query twice (predicate order doesn't matter) returns the **same** stream —
live queries are ref-counted; delete what you create
(`curl -X POST http://localhost:8790/shapes.delete -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"id":"<id>"}'`).

### The predicate JSON AST

| node | wire form |
|---|---|
| comparison | `{"col":"priority","op":"gte","value":3}` — `op` ∈ `eq neq lt lte gt gte` |
| null test | `{"col":"points","isNull":true}` (`false` = `IS NOT NULL`) |
| boolean | `{"and":[…]}` · `{"or":[…]}` · `{"not":…}` |
| subquery | `{"col":"project_id","in":{"table":"project_members","project":"project_id","where":…},"negated":false}` |

The subquery's inner `where` is itself a predicate and may nest further `in` leaves. The
visibility live query from §4, as AST:

```sh
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8790/shapes.create \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "table": "issues",
    "where": {
      "col": "project_id",
      "in": { "table": "project_members", "project": "project_id",
              "where": { "col": "user_id", "op": "eq", "value": 1 } }
    }
  }'
```

### Read the feed (durable streams)

The feed is an ordered log of envelopes. Catch up from the beginning, then long-poll the tail:

```sh
# backfill: everything from the start
curl -i "http://localhost:8791/shape/$SHAPE_ID?offset=-1"

# live tail: long-poll from the last stream-next-offset
curl -i "http://localhost:8791/shape/$SHAPE_ID?offset=$NEXT&live=long-poll"
```

Each response carries `stream-next-offset` (opaque resume token — always read it back) and
`stream-up-to-date` (present when you're caught up); a long-poll that times out with no data is
`204`. The body is a JSON array of State-Protocol envelopes — live query feeds carry **absolute**
membership, just two operations:

```json
[
  {"type":"public.issues","key":"1000","value":{"id":1000,"title":"fix the tailer","status":"todo","priority":4},
   "headers":{"operation":"upsert"}},
  {"type":"public.issues","key":"1000","headers":{"operation":"delete","lsn":"0/1A2B3C4"}}
]
```

`upsert` = the row is in the live query (entered, or changed while inside); `delete` = it left.
Applying envelopes in order to a `key → value` map always yields exactly the live query's
current result set.

### Subset queries — ordered pages

Live queries have no `ORDER BY`/`LIMIT`; pagination is a one-shot **subset query** (pair it with
`subset.live` for a shared changes-only tail — see the live queries guide §5):

```sh
curl -s -G 'http://localhost:8790/subset.query' \
  --data-urlencode 'input={"table":"issues","orderBy":{"col":"priority","desc":true},"limit":2,
                          "where":{"col":"status","op":"eq","value":"todo"}}'
```

```json
{"result":{"data":{"rows":[{"id":1002,"priority":5,"...":"..."},{"id":1000,"priority":4,"...":"..."}],
           "lsn":"0/1A2B3C4"}}}
```

The returned `lsn` positions the page against the live tail: drop tail deltas with a smaller
`lsn` and the merge is exact.

---

## 6. Aggregations

A live scalar over a predicate — `count`, `sum`, `avg`, `min`, `max` — maintained as an
incremental fold and delivered on a feed like any live query. Create one:

```sh
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8790/aggregate.create \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "table": "issues",
    "fn": "sum",
    "col": "points",
    "where": { "col": "status", "op": "neq", "value": "done" }
  }'
```

Same response structure as `shapes.create` above; `col` is required for `sum`/`avg`/`min`/`max`
and ignored for `count`. The aggregate `where` takes leaf/boolean predicates (no subqueries). Read the feed the
same way (`GET http://localhost:8791/shape/$SHAPE_ID?offset=-1…`); the running value is a single
envelope keyed `"agg"`, re-emitted on every change that moves it:

```json
{"type":"public.issues","key":"agg","value":{"value":4,"n":3},"headers":{"operation":"upsert"}}
```

`value` is the aggregate (`null` when `sum`/`avg`/`min`/`max` has no non-null input rows);
`n` is the matching row count. SQL NULL semantics throughout: `count(col)` counts non-null
values only, and `min`/`max` retract correctly (delete the current minimum and the next one is
emitted — the fold is retraction-aware, not append-only).

With the seed data above: `sum(points) WHERE status <> 'done'` is `4` over `n=3` matching rows —
issue 1002's NULL `points` contributes to `n` but not to the sum. Now
`UPDATE issues SET points = 8 WHERE id = 1002;` and the feed emits
`{"value":{"value":12,"n":3}}` — one envelope, no re-scan.

Identical aggregations are de-duplicated like live queries: any number of dashboards
subscribing to the same live count share one fold and one feed.

## 7. Endpoint quick reference

| you want | request |
|---|---|
| health / replication position | `GET :7010/health` · `GET :7010/replication/lsn` |
| live query, Electric protocol (SQL where) | `GET :7010/v1/shape?table=…&offset=-1[&where=…&columns=…]`, then `…&handle=…&offset=…&live=true` |
| live query, extended API (JSON AST) | `POST :8790/shapes.create` → handle; `POST :8790/shapes.delete` |
| read a live query/aggregate feed | `GET :8791/shape/<id>?offset=-1`, then `…?offset=<next>&live=long-poll` |
| ordered page | `GET :8790/subset.query?input=<json>` (+ `POST :8790/subset.live` for the tail) |
| live scalar | `POST :8790/aggregate.create` → feed keyed `"agg"`, value `{value,n}` |

Ports are the Docker defaults: engine `7010`, extended API `8790`, durable streams `8791`.
