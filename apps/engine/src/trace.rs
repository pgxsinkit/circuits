//! Per-envelope pipeline trace: a best-effort broadcast of the route each replicated change took
//! through the maintained pipeline (which family routers / filters / subquery nodes it hit, with
//! what outcome, and which shape streams got appends). Consumed by `GET /trace` (SSE) for
//! visualization/debugging. Delivery is lossy by design: a bounded broadcast channel, no
//! backpressure into the hot path, and zero cost when nobody is subscribed
//! (`receiver_count() == 0` short-circuits before any serialization).
//!
//! Node ids use the same namespace as `/graph`: `table:<t>`, `filter:<shape-id>`,
//! `family:<t>:<col,col>`, `node:<subquery-sig>`, `shape:<shape-id>` — so a UI can animate trace
//! events and apply [`StateEvent`] summaries onto the graph without translation.
