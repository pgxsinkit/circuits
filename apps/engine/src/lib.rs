//! Circuits query engine.
//!
//! Takes change events from the ordered change log and fans each change out to registered shapes,
//! across a three-tier serving model. The **circuit** ([`arrangements`]) is always-on infrastructure
//! (Postgres mode): one shared storage-enabled dbsp circuit maintains disk-spillable table
//! arrangements and counts pipelines, serves point lookups (subquery re-derivations) from local
//! snapshots, and serves membership shapes and decomposable COUNT aggregates end to end — seeding
//! and move-in/out come from arrangement snapshots instead of Postgres backfills. The circuit only
//! serves a shape whose connecting column has a configured index (`CIRCUITS_DBSP_INDEXES` /
//! `_COUNTS`); everything else falls through to the tiers below. The **routing tier**: equality
//! shapes are routed by key (a `key -> shapes` index per template), and indexed standalone
//! predicates by necessary conjunct — the hot path holds **no table data**, only per-shape metadata.
//! The **fallback** serves everything else: stateless three-valued filters and the cross-table
//! subquery registry. Matching deltas are appended (as State-Protocol envelopes) to per-shape
//! durable streams. The Z-set element is a dynamically-typed [`value::Row`] (positional
//! `Vec<Value>`); the schema gives names to the positions. See `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` and
//! `docs/ivm-engine-internals.md` for the system design.

// The single ordered change log lives in [`changelog`]: the ingestor appends whole commits (in
// commit order) to the CURRENT segment and the engine's sequencer consumes them — the envelope's
// `type` field carries the table's canonical `schema.name` (always qualified; see `table_ref` and
// ADR-0002). The log is **segmented** (`changes/0`, `changes/1`, …), rotated by size or age so a
// long-running deployment's disk stays bounded, and a segment is deleted once nothing can resume
// inside it (ADR-0006). Every position in it is a `changelog::LogPosition`.
